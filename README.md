# This is a assigment APP ðŸ‘‹

This app is inspired by the Scratch platform and offers users the ability to create dynamic animations by interacting with multiple spirits. Users can add several spirits to the canvas, assign a variety of actions to each, and watch their creations come to life with a simple play command. The intuitive interface allows for easy customization: users can reset spirit positions, delete actions, or remove spirits as needed, providing a flexible and user-friendly experience.

To efficiently manage application state, the app leverages the Context API, ensuring smooth performance and seamless updates across components. The app is built using core React Native concepts, demonstrating a robust understanding of component-based architecture, state management, and user interaction.
